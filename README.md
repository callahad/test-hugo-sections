For context, see [this post](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/are-sections-used-for-layout-lookup-when-a-page-has-a-custom-content-type/18291) in Hugo's community forum.

Specific question: Why isn't `content/talks/third.md` rendered by `layouts/talks/single.html`? Is there an easy way to make it use the same template as other talks, or am I misusing the `type` parameter in its frontmatter?
